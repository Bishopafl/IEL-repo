# Create a trivia game using the API found at https://opentdb.com/api_config.php

### The game should do the following:
- Ask the player a trivia question and present the possible answers
- Tell the user if they get an answer right or wrong
- Ask multiple questions per game
- A final score that shows once all the questions are answered
- Have a way to play again (without refreshing!)

Please feel free to use Create React App or other tooling if you are more comfortable with them.
We just ask that you use React.
